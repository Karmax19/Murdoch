        <li>Create an engaging website that immerses visitors in Bhutan's beauty, culture, and spirituality.</li>
        <li>Provide informative content that educates users about Bhutan's history, traditions, and landmarks.</li>
        <li>Enhance user engagement through captivating visuals and interactive elements.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Scope of Work</h2>
    <p>My proposed scope includes content enhancement, visual overhaul, and the addition of interactive elements. I plan to complete this project within the specified timeline.</p>
    <h2>Deliverables</h2>
    <p>My deliverables will include website wireframes, fully functional pages, and engaging content (articles, images, videos).</p>
    <h2>Budget and Pricing</h2>
    <p>We propose a budget of $X, with detailed pricing for content creation, design, and development.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Thank you for considering our proposal. We look forward to bringing Bhutan's magic to life on your website!</p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
